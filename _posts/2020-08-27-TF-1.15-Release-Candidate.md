Today **LostTech.TensorFlow**, our C# binding to TensorFlow, gets its first Release
Candidate available to the public. It brings a stable API, that mirrors TensorFlow 1.15,
and includes tensors, graphs, and sessions, along with Keras, an optional
[eager execution mode](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager),
and [much more](https://losttech.software/gradient.html).

Check out [the product webpage](https://losttech.software/gradient.html) for the
[overview of available features](https://losttech.software/gradient.html).
See [our samples](https://github.com/losttech/Gradient-Samples/) or just
install the [NuGet package](https://nuget.org/packages/LostTech.TensorFlow) and start your journey
into deep learning with .NET!

This Release Candidate comes with a go-live license, meaning unlike the previews, it has no
expiration date and is fully supported.

**LostTech.TensorFlow** is completely free for individuals and small businesses, while
larger enterprises can get a [pay-as-you-go license](#pay-as-you-go-via-azure) through their Azure
Subscription, which includes some trial credits. Please, contact
[Sales](https://losttech.software/buy_gradient.html) if you need the license for disconnected use
cases.

## Why LostTech.TensorFlow

### Full deep learning power

To this date [people _struggle_ to implement](https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET/issues/352)
state of the art algorithms for **computer vision (YOLOv3)** and
**language processing (GPT and BERT)** using **TensorFlow.NET**, our competitor, due to the
*lack of required features*.

In comparison, our [**GPT-2 demo**](https://habr.com/post/453232/) was **made in one week** and
included support for training just a month after Open AI released the smaller model back
in February 2019, thanks to the API parity with TensorFlow for Python.

### Best performance

We are using optimized builds of TensorFlow provided by Google, which come with all
performance-related bells and whistles.

We are leaving the full comparison to reviewers, but in
[a simple test](https://github.com/losttech/Gradient-Perf/) we made out of **TensorFlow.NET**'s
official sample, **LostTech.TensorFlow** came about **18% faster than TensorFlow.NET** to train
a convolutional neural network.

The use of the official **TensorFlow** builds with **LostTech.TensorFlow** enables you to take
advantage not only of **NVidia GPUs**, but also of **AMD accelerators** using
[tensorflow-rocm](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-rocm/1.15.4/),
and **Tensor Processing Units** in Google Cloud.

### Integration with Unity ML Agents

**LostTech.TensorFlow** includes support for interaction with virtual environments
built with [**Unity ML Agents**](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

This allows to train deep learning models using .NET in detailed simulated environments,
that can be transferred to power real-life robots. This also opens an opportunity to expand
in-game AI characters with human-like features.

Check out our [blog post](https://ml.blogs.losttech.software/Reinforcement-Learning-With-Unity-ML-Agents/),
that covers building and training an agent in a virtual Unity environment using deep reinforcement
learning.

### Commercial support

We provide full support for **LostTech.TensorFlow** on AMD64/x64 hardware on Linux, MacOS,
and Windows. We will resolve any issues caused by the product in accessing supported TensorFlow 1.15
APIs.

## What's new in this release

### New features and bug fixes

This section describes changes since the Preview 7 released in Q1 2020. To view a summary of
change history prior to Preview 7, check out
[the Release Notes section of the package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gradient/).

#### Static types has been made more precise

- Most used APIs are now better typed. Nearly all methods in `tf` that previously returned `dynamic`
now correctly return `Tensor` objects.
- Introduced `Tensor<T>`, that improves interoperability with generic code.
- `ndarray<T>` has been improved.

#### Easier debugging

- Improved exception handling experience. Most scenarios now throw subclasses of .NET `Exception`
rather than a generic `PythonException` error. Full TensorFlow stack trace is included.
- Core components now include debug symbols.
- The Python interop library package comes with
[Source Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/sourcelink)
enabled giving an easy access to
[its source code](https://github.com/losttech/pythonnet) from IDE.

#### Easy to get started

- By default 1D .NET arrays and LINQ-produced enumerables are automatically converted to
Python lists to simplify interaction with badly-written parts of TensorFlow. This feature can
be disabled using properties of [corresponding codecs](https://gradient.docs.losttech.software/Runtime/v0.4.2/LostTech.Gradient.Codecs/index.htm).

### Closer to the RTM

#### Pay-As-You-Go via Azure

**Pay-As-You-Go** is a novel licensing method, that should help you get started quickly and only
pay for **LostTech.TensorFlow** when you are actually using it.

If you have an existing Azure Subscription, you can get a key through it.
You have to have an [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/grant-access-to-create-subscription?tabs=rest%2Crest-2#audit-who-created-subscriptions-using-activity-logs)
role to set it up. **The key can be used on any
Internet-connected machine** (intermittent connectivity issues are well-tolerated),
**including machines outside of Azure fabric, such as company workstations**.
Our licensing library will record the time
the process is running along with the information about the host hardware, and
**charge your Azure Subscription** accordingly.

The offer includes about **200 free hours per month of training/inference**
on a Tesla K80 GPU (hardware not included).

#### Stable API

Starting with Release Candidate, future versions of **LostTech.TensorFlow** will adhere to
[SemVer](https://semver.org/), meaning that the code written with older version will be compatible
with any future updates up until 2.0 is released.

#### Go-live

The Release Candidate has no expiration date, and comes with a license, that permits commercial use.
However, you will have to upgrade to the final release once it is out to continue receiving support.

#### New package name: LostTech.TensorFlow

For clarity, we changed the name of the NuGet package to
[**LostTech.TensorFlow**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LostTech.TensorFlow).
[**Gradient**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gradient) package will be marked obsolete and should
not be used.

## Conclusion

**LostTech.TensorFlow** is a powerful deep learning library for .NET, that can be used to build
state of the art algorithms with just a few lines of code on your platform of choice
without the need to leave the familiar tech stack.
