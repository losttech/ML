We just released
[LostTech.TensorFlow 2.4 Preview 1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LostTech.TensorFlow/2.4.1-preview1)
on NuGet. This is the first preview of our TensorFlow binding for .NET, that targets
TensorFlow 2.x.

Take a look at TensorFlow official documentation to see
[what's new in TensorFlow 2.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/effective_tf2#a_brief_summary_of_major_changes).

We also updated [Samples](https://github.com/losttech/Gradient-Samples) to work with the Preview.

TensorFlow 2 by default works in [eager execution mode](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager).
Most samples, that use TF 1.x style require legacy
[Session](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1/Session)-based mode instead.
It can be enabled at the start of the program by calling `v1.disable_eager_exection()`.
Legacy TF 1.x APIs are available in `v1` class under `tensorflow.compat.v1` namespace.
