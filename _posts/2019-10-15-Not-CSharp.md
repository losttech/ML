![Screenshot of an app, that recognizes C#](https://lostmsu.github.io/images/NotCSharp.png)

In Silicon Valley season 4, Jian-Yang builds an AI app that identifies pictures of hotdogs.
Today I am going to make a similar app to identify C# from code fragments (in case you forget how C# looks like!).

Look at this Python trying to pretend to be your favorite language:

```python
var = await.add(item)
switch(hello)
```

Everything from building and training a deep convolutional network with custom layers
to the cross-platform UI will be written in C#.
